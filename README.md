I build and operate cloud-native, production-grade systems: microservices and APIs written in Go and Rust, and user-facing applications built with React and TypeScript. I focus on performance, reliability, observability, and pragmatic engineering that scales across teams and traffic.

## About Me

Senior Fullstack Developer with deep experience in building cloud-native microservices, developer-friendly APIs, and high-quality frontends. I architect and implement systems using Go and Rust for back-end services and React + TypeScript for front-end applications. I operationalize services with observability, automated CI/CD, and resilient deployment patterns.

Core strengths:

- Designing and building microservices and distributed systems (Go, Rust)
- Frontend systems with React + TypeScript, component architecture, and testing
- Cloud-native delivery: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code
- Observability: structured logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Performance, security, fault tolerance, and production readiness
- Mentorship, technical leadership, and cross-functional collaboration

---

## Core Competencies

- Languages: Go, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Python, PHP
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript-first component design, modern CSS (Tailwind)
- Backend: Go (microservices, gRPC, HTTP), Rust (high-performance services), Node.js/TypeScript
- Architecture: Microservices, event-driven design, API-first development (OpenAPI)
- Cloud & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), IaC (Terraform)
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, structured logging, distributed tracing
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, timeseries & caching strategies
- Testing & Quality: unit/integration testing, contract tests, type-driven development

## Tech Stack & Tools

### Backend & Systems
![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
![gRPC](https://img.shields.io/badge/gRPC-00ADD8?style=flat)
- Microservices and APIs (Go, Rust); HTTP, gRPC, protobufs, async/event-driven patterns
- Service design for scalability, observability, and resilience

### Frontend
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=black)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
- React + TypeScript, Next.js for server-rendered apps, component-driven design, testing

### Cloud, DevOps & Observability
![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-326CE5?style=flat&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=flat&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![Prometheus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prometheus-263238?style=flat)
![Grafana](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grafana-F46800?style=flat)
- Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS/GCP, CI/CD pipelines, automated deployments
- Observability with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, structured logs, distributed tracing

### Data & Testing
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis; schema design and performance tuning
- Testing: unit, integration, contract tests, e2e pipelines; type-driven development

---

## What I Deliver

Inputs:
- Product requirements, user stories, or a problem statement

Outputs:
- Production-ready features (UI + API) with tests and documentation
- Deployment-ready artifacts (Dockerfiles, Helm charts, CI/CD pipelines)
- Observability and runbooks for on-call and post-deploy diagnostics

Success criteria:
- Features meet acceptance criteria and automated tests pass
- Predictable performance and graceful error handling at scale
- Clear README, run instructions, and handoff documentation

---

## How I Work

1. Define the smallest valuable iteration and validate assumptions.
2. Deliver incrementally with CI, tests, and automated deployments.
3. API-first, contract-driven design (OpenAPI/protobuf) and clear docs.
4. Automate observability and runbooks to reduce incident-to-fix time.

Edge cases I plan for:
- Missing or malformed input data
- High-latency or failing downstream services (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers)
- Authentication/authorization edge cases and least-privilege principals
- Backwards compatibility and safe, incremental migrations


## Hiring & Collaboration

- Roles I take: Senior Fullstack Engineer, Tech Lead, Backend/Platform Engineer, Contractor for greenfield and brownfield projects
- Availability: full-time / contract / remote
- Preferred workflow: small milestones, regular demos, code reviews, and automated testing
