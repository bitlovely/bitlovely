## About me

I am a Full Stack Developer focused on building production-ready web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and TypeScript across the stack and have deep experience with React, Vue, Node/Express, PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), Python (Django), and Go. I design intuitive user experiences, clean APIs, and scalable systems that make teams and products more productive.

Core strengths:

- End-to-end web application development (UI, API, persistence, deployment)
- Strong TypeScript-first approach for front-end and back-end
- Pragmatic architecture: performance, security, observability
- Mentoring, technical leadership, and cross-functional collaboration

- Database design and optimization
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth)
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## What I deliver (contract)

Inputs:

- Product requirements, user stories, or a problem statement

Outputs:

- Production-ready features (UI + API + tests + docs)
- Deployment-ready artifacts (Dockerfile, CI config)
- Short onboarding notes and handoff documentation

Success criteria:

- Feature meets acceptance criteria and tests pass
- Predictable performance and reasonable error handling
- Clear README and run instructions for future maintainers

---

## How I work

1. Understand the problem and define small iterations.
2. Deliver working software early — iterate with tests and CI.
3. Keep APIs contract-driven and document them (OpenAPI / README).
4. Automate where it removes repetitive risk (tests, linting, deployments).

Edge cases I plan for:

- Empty or missing input data
- High-latency or failing downstream services
- Auth and permission edge cases
- Backwards compatibility during iterative releases

## Selected Project Examples (templates — add your projects)

- Project A — Single-page app + API
	- Short: SEO-friendly React frontend, Express/TypeScript API, PostgreSQL
	- Why: Fast UX, server-rendered pieces for SEO, robust data model

- Project B — SaaS admin panel
	- Short: Vue 3 + TypeScript, Laravel backend, Redis caching
	- Why: Manage complex user roles and billing workflows with clear audit logs

Replace these with real project names, links, and short bullets describing the challenge, your role, tech used, and measurable outcome.
